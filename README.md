# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized framework designed to manage and optimize the context window for large language models (LLMs). MCP enables efficient context handling, including dynamic insertion, prioritization, and compression of information to improve model performance and reduce token usage. This protocol is particularly useful for applications requiring long-context reasoning, chat systems, or any scenario where maintaining relevant context is crucial.

Whether you're building AI agents, conversational interfaces, or research tools, MCP provides a lightweight, extensible protocol to streamline context management.
